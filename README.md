# BasicBankingSystem
Making a banking system with c++

this code was actually written 3days ago but i didn't know i could commit an already existing code to github,
what i had in mind was, before summint or commiting to github repo , you'll need to start the project from github first but 
after showig my class mates and they think okay its cool,
i decided to look for a way to connect my compilar with github and basically send the code over to github with ease - :)

im happy for this one :)
